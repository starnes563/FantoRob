Television: Now let's go to our public security commentator, Matheus Uchôa.
Television: Matheus, what's your take on this frightening situation?
Television: Well, Renata, I've seen people comparing this self-proclaimed terrorist group, FantoMask,
Television: To the Shindo Renmei, and I think that's a disservice.
Television: The Shindo Renmei was an organization that operated in the countryside of São Paulo in the 1940s after World War II.
Television: It was formed by small Japanese farmers who couldn't accept Japan's defeat.
Television: FantoMask, on the other hand, seems to have operated in the interior of Goiás after the Third War, but the comparisons end there.
Television: The Shindo Renmei probably slit the throats of about 30 people with katanas.
Television: We're dealing with a possible bomb in an auditorium with 25 THOUSAND people at the final of one of the most-watched championships in Brazil in years.
Television: The level of danger and complexity of the FantoMask operation is on a much larger scale.
Television: So, it's a limited and somewhat unnecessary comparison.
Television: Now, here's my question: Where was the intelligence of the civil police?
Television: Where were the public security forces, the local authorities who didn't notice a terrorist organization...
Television: Form, operate, and plant a bomb right under everyone's nose.
Television: This is a scandal. Goianópolis is located between Goiânia and the capital, two huge cities.
Television: What if FantoMask decides to explode a bomb in a subway? It leaves me stunned, you know.
Television: The incompetence of the public security authorities in allowing the situation to reach this point.
Television: Now, all we can do is hope. Nobody knows yet what this group wants, so there's nothing to negotiate.
Television: Thank you very much, Matheus. We'll be back with more live updates shortly.
