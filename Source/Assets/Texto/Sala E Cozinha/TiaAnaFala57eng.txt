Aunt Ana: You slept in a lot! Mr. Oswaldo is getting impatient.
Aunt Ana: Today is your big day. Who would have thought a Christmas toy would turn into all this?
Aunt Ana: I won't be able to be there with you.
Neftari: It's okay, Aunt, I understand.
Aunt Ana: Of course, you do...
Aunt Ana: Nef, you have a heart of gold. With fame come many good and bad opportunities.
Aunt Ana: Never forget who you are, alright?
Neftari: Alright!
Aunt Ana: A bad choice may seem good at the moment, but in the future, it always brings disaster.
Neftari: Wow, Aunt, okay...
Aunt Ana: Just being a typical aunt, Nef. Now go, they're waiting for you.
