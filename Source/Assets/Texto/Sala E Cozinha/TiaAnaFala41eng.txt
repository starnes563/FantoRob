Aunt Ana: Neftari, I heard you're going to Henrique's party, Zé da Borracha's son.
Neftari: Yes, almost everyone is going, except João because nobody likes him.
Aunt Ana: What are you going to give as a gift?
Neftari:...
Neftari: Don't worry, I've already bought it. I have money.
Aunt Ana: That's exactly why! 
Aunt Ana: I haven't forgotten what you did last time!
Neftari: I didn't do anything too bad.
Aunt Ana: Nothing too bad?
Aunt Ana: Imagine my face when the school principal told me that you had given a 48-hour deodorant at the party they threw for your history teacher.
Neftari: I like to give practical gifts.
Aunt Ana: Even your best friend isn't spared from your mischief!
Aunt Ana: Marcus's mom said you gave him a barber shop haircut voucher! I was so embarrassed!
Neftari: It's not mischief; his haircut was bad, and I wanted to help.
Aunt Ana: Tell me, Neftari, what did you buy for the son of the tire repairman?
Neftari:...
Aunt Ana: Neftari?
Neftari:...
Neftari: I bought eyebrow tweezers...
Aunt Ana: But, Neftari!
Neftari: His eyebrows are so bad that if you point your camera at them, it tries to read a QR code!
Aunt Ana: You'd better go buy something else.
Neftari: Okay, I'll buy an anti-dandruff shampoo.
Aunt Ana: Even worse!
Neftari: But, Aunt, his dandruff is so bad it looks like Silent Hill's fog!
Aunt Ana: You really have no hope, do you?
