Miguel Maromba: Neftari, what's this about making my brother cry? I'm going to teach you a lesson; let's have a battle right now!
Arnaldo: I haven't allowed any chaos at the store's entrance yet!
Miguel Maromba: But, but... MOMMY!
Arnaldo: Wow, you're good.
???: May I ask your name, kid?
Neftari: It's Neftari.
???: Nice to meet you; mine's OSWALDO. Well, Neftari, you battle well, you have talent. Have you ever thought about using that talent beyond just playing?
Neftari: I haven't really thought about it.
Oswaldo: Haha, a very silly question to ask a kid your age, my apologies. Getting straight to the point, if I offer you an ENDORSEMENT LETTER, would you accept?
Neftari: OF COURSE I WOULD!
Oswaldo: It was expected that you already know what I'm talking about.
Marcus Vinícius: What's an ENDORSEMENT LETTER?
Neftari: An ENDORSEMENT LETTER is one of the ways you can enter the FantoRob Summer Championship. Don't you watch it every year?
Oswaldo: That's right, I'm a talent scout for the FANTOROB COMPANY, and I can provide endorsement letters, but only a limited number.
Oswaldo: The championship starts next week, so I have only one more left.
Neftari: Do I need to do something for you to give me this letter?
Oswaldo: No, you need to register 2 FANTOROBS when entering the championship, and at least one of them must be BASIC COMPLEXITY 1.
Neftari: Well, I have the GIRONOROB, which is BASIC 1, but I don't have another FantoRob.
Oswaldo: I can't give you the letter without being sure you can enter, but let's do this: I usually hang out at the FANTOROB TOWER, taking care of my business all day,
Oswaldo: If you manage to get a second FantoRob, look for me there, and I'll give you the letter.
Neftari: DEAL!
Oswaldo: I'll be waiting.
Marcus Vinícius: Nef, you can borrow my BOBROB.
Neftari: I don't think it's a good idea; the championship is very intense, and it could break, and more. I need to find another FantoRob somehow. Do you know any loan sharks?
Marcus Vinícius: ARE YOU CRAZY, OF COURSE NOT!
Neftari: Relax, it's a joke.
Arnaldo: I can help.
Marcus Vinícius: How?
Arnaldo: Well, a few minutes ago, a boy came in here crying with his mom, and they bought a bunch of wax for his FantoRob. I guess it was the kid you beat.
Neftari: Must have been Enzo.
Arnaldo: So if you defeat more people, they'll come here to buy wax, and I'll get a commission.
Arnaldo: Beat 5 people and come back, and I'll give you another used FantoRob I have here.
Marcus Vinícius: Isn't that kind of unethical?
Neftari: It's a deal!
