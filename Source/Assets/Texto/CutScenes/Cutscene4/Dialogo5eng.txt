Neftari: Can I get two waxes?
Arnaldo: Look at that! Good morning, Neftari! I see your aunt already gave you the GIRINOROB I got for her.
Neftari: Did you sell it to her?
Arnaldo: Yes, I did, about a week ago. It's an older GIRINOROB, so I gave her a friendly price, but it should still do the job.
Arnaldo: We don't usually deal with used products here in the store. To be honest, I hadn't even noticed that GIRINOROB just sitting in the corner.
Arnaldo: It's almost like it was just waiting for your aunt to come buy it for you, hahaha!
Neftari: I see, I guess it came with a side of humiliation too, right?
Arnaldo: No way! When your aunt told me it was a Christmas present, I even fixed it up and put it in a brand-new box!
Arnaldo: Just be careful not to go battling around with it.
Marcus Vin√≠cius: Oops, too late! On the way here, it already got into two!
Arnaldo: AND THE GIRINOROB HELD UP?
Neftari: I won both battles.
Arnaldo: YOU WON?!
Neftari: Why are you shouting?
Arnaldo: Man, either you got lucky or you're really skilled, but anyway, here's your two waxes.
Neftari: Take yours back, Marcus; I'm going to use the other one.
Arnaldo: You won twice with that FantoRob? I'm impressed!
