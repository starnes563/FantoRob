Fantohelper: Hello, I'm the Fantohelper, here to assist you throughout the championship.
Fantohelper: This is the third challenge, PIRATE SHIP, where you will encounter FantoRobs at Intermediate level 1 and 2.
Fantohelper: To change things up a bit, this challenge will be a little different.
Fantohelper: Your goal is to reach and defeat the ship's captain, who's waiting in the cabin.
Fantohelper: However, the cabin will be locked, and to open it, you must complete the challenge proposed by the pirates dressed in green.
Fantohelper: The challenge is to match the sequence of illuminated squares in the same order they appear.
Fantohelper: If you get it right, the pirate will unlock the next door; if you get it wrong, you'll have to battle.
Fantohelper: This challenge is non-linear, meaning you will likely pass through the same places several times before finishing.
Fantohelper: If you're having too much difficulty, perhaps your FantoRobs are too weak for the challenge.
Fantohelper: Always remember to visit the FantoLab to enhance them with the items you acquire.
Fantohelper: Good luck!
