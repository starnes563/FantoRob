Fantohelper: Hello, I'm the Fantohelper, here to assist you throughout the championship.
Fantohelper: This is the fourth challenge, THE CASTLE, where you will encounter FantoRobs at Intermediate level 2 and Advanced 1.
Fantohelper: Your goal is to defeat the king in the throne room.
Fantohelper: The throne room is locked, and to open it, you must defeat the 4 special knights scattered throughout the castle.
Fantohelper: You can defeat them in any order, and you only need to defeat them once.
Fantohelper: I know what you're thinking: Is it that simple? And I say yes.
Fantohelper: If you're having too much difficulty, perhaps your FantoRobs are too weak for the challenge.
Fantohelper: Always remember to visit the FantoLab to enhance them with the items you acquire.
Fantohelper: Good luck!
