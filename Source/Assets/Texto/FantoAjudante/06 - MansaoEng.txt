Fantohelper: Hello, I'm the Fantohelper, here to assist you throughout the championship.
Fantohelper: This is the sixth challenge, THE HAUNTED MANSION, where you will encounter FantoRobs at Advanced level 1, 2, and 3.
Fantohelper: Your objective is to find all FOUR missing keys for the ORGAN in the library.
Fantohelper: The keys are hidden in chests throughout the mansion.
Fantohelper: Finding the keys is not enough; you must place all four in the ORGAN.
Fantohelper: But this mansion is haunted, which means it can be quite confusing.
Fantohelper: Some doors, for example, only open from one side.
Fantohelper: If you're having too much difficulty, perhaps your FantoRobs are too weak for the challenge.
Fantohelper: Always remember to visit the FantoLab to enhance them with the items you acquire.
Fantohelper: Good luck!
