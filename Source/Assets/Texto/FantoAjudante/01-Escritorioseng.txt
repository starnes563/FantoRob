???: Hello, I'm the Fantohelper, here to assist you throughout the championship.
Fantohelper: This is the first challenge, THE OFFICES, where you will encounter FantoRobs at Basic levels 1 and 2.
Fantohelper: Your goal is to reach the manager's room and defeat the Champion.
Fantohelper: To do this, you must explore all the floors, obtain keys, unlock doors...
Fantohelper: Additionally, there's a special item exclusive to this challenge that is necessary to proceed.
Fantohelper: When you reach the manager's room, don't forget to unlock the shortcut.
Fantohelper: If you're having too much difficulty, perhaps your FantoRobs are too weak for the challenge.
Fantohelper: Always remember to visit the FantoLab to enhance them with the items you acquire.
Fantohelper: Good luck!
