Fantohelper: Hello, I'm the Fantohelper, here to assist you throughout the championship.
Fantohelper: This is the fifth challenge, the NEW MINES of Goian√≥polis 2, where you will encounter FantoRobs at Advanced level 1 and 2.
Fantohelper: Your objective, as always, is to reach the champion's room.
Fantohelper: To do that, you must navigate the complex and caves, find keys, open doors...
Fantohelper: Here, you'll also use mine carts a lot to move around inside the caves.
Fantohelper: Just be careful with the most dangerous parts of the cave; no risky adventures.
Fantohelper: As you can see, there's a locked gate here.
Fantohelper: Opening it will allow you to take a shortcut, which speeds things up.
Fantohelper: If you're having too much difficulty, perhaps your FantoRobs are too weak for the challenge.
Fantohelper: Always remember to visit the FantoLab to enhance them with the items you acquire.
Fantohelper: Good luck!
