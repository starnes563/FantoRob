Fantohelper: Hello, I'm the Fantohelper, here to assist you throughout the championship.
Fantohelper: This is the second challenge, WATER FARM, where you will encounter FantoRobs at Basic level 2 and Intermediate level 1.
Fantohelper: This is the water recapturing plant responsible for supplying the entire region.
Fantohelper: Your goal is to reach the end and challenge the leader.
Fantohelper: To do that, you must explore the entire complex, find keys, open chests, and so on.
Fantohelper: However, the path won't be so simple; the water changes the available routes.
Fantohelper: That's why you need to find the valve somewhere in the challenge to change the water level.
Fantohelper: Be careful not to get wet, and no trying to climb onto the reserve tanks!
Fantohelper: Last year, we had someone trying to be adventurous, and it ended with a broken arm.
Fantohelper: If you're having too much difficulty, perhaps your FantoRobs are too weak for the challenge.
Fantohelper: Always remember to visit the FantoLab to enhance them with the items you acquire.
Fantohelper: Good luck!
