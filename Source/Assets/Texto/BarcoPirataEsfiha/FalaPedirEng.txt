Hungry Pirate: I went to buy a chocolate esfiha from the esfiha Nazi, and when I ordered it, he kicked me out!
Hungry Pirate: Now what will I do? I'm nearly starving!
Hungry Pirate: Hey, I have an idea. Why don't you go in my place and buy an esfiha for me?
Hungry Pirate: If you do me this favor, I'll give you a treasure.
Hungry Pirate: I want one with MEAT, CHEESE, and CHOCOLATE.
