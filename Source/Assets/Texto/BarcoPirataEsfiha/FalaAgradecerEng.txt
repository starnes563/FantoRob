Hungry Pirate: Wow, thanks! Here's my treasure. (Received a BOAT key)
Hungry Pirate: Huh, where's the chocolate ESFIHA?
Neftari: The Nazi doesn't sell it; it's a trap.
Hungry Pirate: Aw, I really love the taste of cheese with chocolate...
Neftari: Buy a chocolate pizza then, I guess.
Hungry Pirate: Well, it's not the same as this marvelous ESFIHA, but a deal's a deal.
