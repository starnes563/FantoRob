Augusto: Wow, there was a point where you disappeared, and I got worried.
Augusto: I thought you had a "date" or something.
Neftari: Well, sort of.
Neftari: I'll explain later, but it was good.
Augusto: It's a relief that when you came back, you came back strong.
Augusto: The annoying thing is that that crappy Pre√° guy finished before you.
Augusto: On the bright side, I've also finished, and I'm close to qualifying.
Neftari: Tsk, in the end, they managed to do it.
Augusto: What?
Neftari: Dude, meet me at the little farm tomorrow, you know where it is?
Augusto: Where people say the golden fish appears.
Neftari: I also have to tell you this story, but show up there around 10, okay?
Augusto: Deal.
